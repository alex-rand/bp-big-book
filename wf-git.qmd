# Git and Github {#sec-wf-git}

Git is a _version control system_. 
It tracks the changes you make and _commit_ to files in a _local repository_.
It lets you apply those changes to _remote repositories_ hosted on services like Github. 

## Gitting rolling

At a minimum, you'll need to [install git](https://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html) and [register a Github account](https://happygitwithr.com/github-acct.html).
Optionally, you can also integrate git and Github into your [RStudio environment](https://happygitwithr.com/rstudio-git-github.html). 
If you've done those things already, great, you're good to go! 
Otherwise, it is _strongly recommended_ that you pause what you're doing now and read / work through [Happy Git](https://happygitwithr.com/) before continuing. 

## Usage at Blueprint (as of May 2023)

Right now, usage is highly varied. 
Some members of the Data Lab team use git and Github for version control and hosting of both R packages and analysis project code. 
It is not, however, part of the typical analysis project. 
We will begin rolling out the [basic workflow](#sec-wf-basic) in the summer of 2023 and see how it goes.
