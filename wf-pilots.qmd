# Workflow Pilots

This chapter is a collection area for promising workflow practices at Blueprint. 
Look here to see what other printers are experimenting with right now. 

## Using Github Issues to Host a Project's Decision Log

| Meta    | data                     |
|--------:|:-------------------------|
| project | FSC Benchmarks           |
| repo    | [alex-rand/fsc-benchmarks](https://github.com/alex-rand/fsc-benchmarks/issues) |
| contact | @alex-rand               |

### What is the practice? 

- use Github's Issues tracker to: 
  + ask and answer questions about program, data, and methods
  + collaboratively arrive at decisions about the best path forward
  + label conversations to help others focus their contributions
- connect tasks (branches, pull requests) to the conversations that produced them

### Why is it good? 

- lives in an obvious, highly accessible place attached to the project's repo 
- enables transparent, asynchronous, collaborative decision-making
- organically documents that process
- provides an intuitive interface for tracking down the rationale for decisions which would otherwise be forgotten
- labels make it easy to highlight issues for specific team members or cross-functional collaborators
- code reviewers have a clear first stop for answering questions about decisions reflected in the code they're reviewing

### What does it look like?
